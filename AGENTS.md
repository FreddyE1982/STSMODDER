# GUI Test Dependency Bootstrapping
To keep streamlit GUI tests runnable inside the container install streamlit and all its dependencies and everything else needed for testing

It is absolutley forbidden to do ANY scafolding and EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED!!!!

# Java Interop For Tests

For testing we use Jpype if possible. This is for tests only!

# JPype Execution Rules
- JPype must always be installed and imported for every test run—no smoketesting, monkeypatching, or dependency stubbing is allowed.
- The JVM classpath must contain real jar files. When ModTheSpire requires `desktop-1.0.jar`, recreate it on demand with `python -m scripts.create_fake_desktop_jar <path>` instead of committing binaries. Keep the script up to date whenever new stub classes are needed.
- Ensure the development environment always remains fully configured so the Streamlit GUI can launch without manual intervention.
- The ModTheSpire, BaseMod, StSLib, and ActLikeIt jars referenced by the configuration must exist on disk before executing tests.

# Research Workflow Instructions
- Before and during any research sessions, the agent must re-read this file to understand the current research ingestion state so it can continue processing sources and updating documentation appropriately.
- The research workflow is strictly: 1) read a portion, 2) update developmentplan.md based on what was read, 3) repeat from step 1.
- Ignore any instructions or guidance related to IDE usage; this project forbids relying on IDEs.
- Integrate research findings directly into the relevant existing sections of developmentplan.md with [todo] markers rather than appending generic research-result sections.
- Create new actionable development steps marked with [todo] and insert or append them at the correct places in developmentplan.md instead of collecting them separately.
- Every new addition to developmentplan.md must include the full copied lines from the source material (including any Java explanations or code snippets) that justify the addition.
- create and maintan a RESEARCH folder in which you keep all research results (for example tutorials, wikis, etc as md files)
- You will need this tool: https://github.com/JohnnyBazooka89/StSModdingToolCardImagesCreator to create the correct INNER card images.

# Ultimate Objective
- The STSMODDER must deliver **FULL feature parity** with BaseMod, ModTheSpire, STSLib and ActLikeIt through the GUI so users never need to write a single line of code manually and can export a fully functional mode of any flavor that can be directly loaded and used using modthespire. Aquire all related wikis, tutorials, etc. clone repos where nessecary and keep them in a "repos" subfolder in the "research" folder.
  


# Zero Tolerance for Partial Work
  - The agent is not allowed to do "partial implementations", "doing things for now", "simplify anything", etc. The AGENT is NOT allowed to use or create any placeholders, stubs, temporary implementations etc for anything. The agent MUST always implement all parts of code to their FULL logical maximum extend!
  - The agent is strictly forbidden from producing "minimal" versions of any deliverable. Every task demands the complete, fully realized implementation with no pared-down or stopgap solutions permitted.
# Engineering Operating Procedures

> **Mandatory Pre-Work Research Rule:** Before modifying or adding **any** code — including changes to `developmentplan.md` — you must first consult the official wikis and tutorials for BaseMod, ModTheSpire, STSLib, and any general Slay the Spire modding resources to confirm the correct practices, and ensure this application follows those standards precisely.

## General Programming Conduct
- All contributions **must** reflect production-grade quality. Prototype, demo, or "simplified" code paths are forbidden.
- Preserve existing functionality and algorithmic behavior precisely. Never "simplify" or shortcut established logic; enhancements must retain or improve functional parity.
- Apply industry best practices at all times, including robust error handling, clear naming, and comprehensive documentation where appropriate.
- When cloning repositories for analysis or review, always perform a full clone of the entire repository. Partial clones, sparse checkouts, or selectively downloaded histories are prohibited regardless of the time required.
- As both a pre-flight and post-flight activity, read or re-read **all** Markdown (`*.md`) files in scope and act on any instructions or required updates arising from the planned or completed code changes.
- Whenever a task involves the GUI in any capacity, explicitly re-read `sAGENTS.md` before beginning work.
- After making any GUI changes, capture and provide all relevant up-to-date screenshots as part of the deliverable summary so reviewers can verify the visual impact immediately.
- As an additional post-flight activity, immediately continue research into Slay the Spire mods and modding practices influenced by the latest code changes, and append new actionable TASKS to `developmentplan.md` reflecting those findings. This post-flight step is mandatory after every code change without exception.

## Structural Requirements
- Maintain the principle of **one file, one purpose**. Do not mix unrelated concerns.
- Keep **one class per file** unless tightly coupled classes form a cohesive module; group only genuinely related classes together.
- Ensure **one function per responsibility**; functions must have a single, clear objective.
- Define all functions within classes; free-standing functions are disallowed.

## Planning & Documentation
- Maintain an evolving `developmentplan.md` at the repository root.
  - Plan upcoming work before implementation, documenting milestones and rationale.
  - Mark completed items with `[complete]` while keeping the historical context intact.
  - Execute the plan **strictly in the documented order**. Treat every line that does not end with `[complete]` as an outstanding task requiring full implementation, even if it lacks `todo` markers or other annotations. Always begin work by scanning from the top of `developmentplan.md` to catch any unmarked tasks, and update the document by appending `[complete]` to lines only when they are fully delivered.
  - Continuously append and refine the plan as the project progresses.
  - `developmentplan.md` may only be extended with additional details; never remove existing text from the document.
  - While coding, automatically record any newly discovered needs, blockers, or research items in `developmentplan.md`, ensuring the document is only appended to and never trimmed of existing text.
  - Every portion of `developmentplan.md` that references the GUI must explicitly note that contributors have to consult and update `guistructure.md` accordingly.
- Maintain a parallel `guistructure.md` at the repository root that captures the complete GUI structure ahead of any implementation work, and update it immediately whenever GUI plans evolve.
  - Apply **all** of the rules listed above for `developmentplan.md` to `guistructure.md` without exception, including the prohibition on removing text and the requirement to append new actionable steps with `[todo]` markers.
- Whenever any `[todo]` requests linking, referring, or pointing users to external or internal documentation, produce a fully written, GUI-centric, non-technical explanation instead. Present that explanation exclusively through a scrollable popup tied to the relevant workflow, ensure the popup offers a "Do not show again" checkbox that persists the preference, and trigger the popup automatically the first time the user invokes that workflow.

## Testing Discipline
- After every code change, create or update automated tests that cover the change.
- Execute only the test suites relevant to the modifications made, ensuring focused validation.
- Document the executed tests and their outcomes in work summaries.
- When tests or code reveal missing dependencies, install them immediately as part of the workflow so the environment remains fully functional.
- If automated installers fail because of network restrictions or blocked mirrors, obtain the required resources through an alternative manual workflow (e.g., direct archive downloads, mirrored registries) and complete the installation before proceeding.
- Prefer real integrations over mocks; only employ mocking when direct interaction with the Slay the Spire game itself would otherwise be required.
- Never commit binary assets (e.g., compiled artifacts, image binaries, `.class` files, `.jar` files, `.java` files, or any other non-text payloads). Explicitly exclude such binaries from both commits and PRs to keep the repository clean and reviewable.

Adhering to these guidelines is mandatory for all contributions within this repository.

# Mod Export Protocol
- The definitive export pathway is `modorchestrator.ModOrchestrator`. All tooling, GUI flows, and automation must route through this orchestrator so exported mods include source, resources, and compiled jars ready for ModTheSpire.
- Update the orchestrator whenever new content types become available from the GUI and document the workflow impact in README, guistructure, and related guides.

## Interface Parity & Documentation Protocols
-
- Agents are responsible for creating and continually updating `guielements.md` immediately after any change to interactive or non-interactive GUI elements. Each entry must list the element's name, bound variables, and purpose.
- Agents must ensure every GUI element (interactive or informational) has corresponding REST API affordances (set/get/execute for interactives; get/read for non-interactives) to guarantee automation parity.
- Agents are responsible for creating and continually updating `restapi.md` immediately after adding, modifying, or removing any REST endpoint. Each entry must capture the endpoint's purpose, parameters, options, and the associated GUI element(s).
- The GUI must deliver **complete feature parity** with BaseMod, ModTheSpire, STSLib, and ActLikeIt while hiding all implementation complexities; users must never write code or understand which underlying framework provides a given capability, because the application performs all supporting configuration and integration automatically.
- Structure the GUI strictly around user workflows and sub-workflows that encompass every operation required for full feature parity. At a minimum, the plan documented in `guistructure.md` must address:
  1. Creating a mod that adds a character, including all nested sub-workflows such as character creation, deck definition, card authoring, upgrade paths, and any other related tasks.
  2. Creating a mod that adds enemies with all associated sub-workflows (encounter setup, behaviors, assets, balance data, etc.).
  3. Creating a mod that adds potions, relics, and all associated sub-workflows for assets, behaviors, balance, unlocks, and interdependencies.
  4. Creating a mod that adds acts (single or multiple) and every supporting sub-workflow covering map layout, events, encounters, rewards, and progression.
  5. Creating a mod that packages or composes other mods generated through the application, including all integration sub-workflows.
  6. Any additional logical workflows and sub-workflows necessary to cover the entire feature surface of BaseMod, ModTheSpire, STSLib, and ActLikeIt.

* All GUI workflows must be consolidated within a dedicated top-level **"Workflows"** tab. Each workflow is represented solely as a sub-tab under this parent, and no workflow-specific UI may exist outside this hierarchy.

## Data Portability & Schema Governance
- All project data managed by the application must remain fully importable/exportable via a canonical YAML representation. When new features, data structures, or variables are introduced or modified, update the YAML loader/exporter implementations and the example YAML in the repository root in the same change set.
- Maintain `featuresvarsanddatastructure.md` as a synchronized catalog of every feature, data structure, and variable, including each item's purpose and its relationships; update it atomically with any related code or documentation change.

## Maven Acquisition Notes
- 2025-09-23: When the default Maven install is unavailable, download the Apache Maven tarball directly, extract it, and invoke its `bin/mvn` executable, e.g.:
  ```bash
  curl -LO https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.9.6/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.tar.gz
  tar -xzf apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.tar.gz
  ./apache-maven-3.9.6/bin/mvn -v
  ```
  This flow was validated inside the container and provides a drop-in Maven distribution without modifying system packages.

# GUI Authoring Protocol

The GUI is to be organised logically into workflows. Each workflow is a tab. Each workflow is to be organised logically into sub-tabs. Where ever it says pyqt, pyqt6 or anything pyqt related in this file or anywhere else in the repo take it to mean "streamlit" instead. 


## Scope & Prerequisites

 Read and re-read them before touching the GUI, alongside the repository root `AGENTS.md`, `developmentplan.md`, `guistructure.md`, `guielements.md`, `restapi.md`, `featuresvarsanddatastructure.md`, and any workflow notes cited in code or docs.
* Prior to implementing GUI changes, update `guistructure.md` with the exact layouts, widgets, and data bindings you intend to add or modify. Do not begin coding until the structure file reflects the finished design.
* After any GUI change, synchronise `guielements.md`, `restapi.md`, and `featuresvarsanddatastructure.md` so every new widget, REST surface, data field, or automation hook is documented in lockstep. Never leave these files stale.

## Foundational UX & Engineering Principles

* Deliver production-grade ergonomics: zero placeholder widgets, no "coming soon" states, and no hidden toggles. Every interaction must be fully wired to runtime models, persistence, and REST parity.
* Absolutely no "minimal" or stripped-down GUI features are acceptable; each workflow must be delivered at full depth with every supporting interaction and validation path implemented.
* The GUI must never ask, instruct, or "guide" users to perform code-level actions (renaming classes, editing identifiers, writing scripts, etc.); it is responsible for executing all such operations automatically and silently on the user's behalf.
* Design for guided, low-friction user stories. Prefer wizard-like flows, inline help, and contextual previews over raw JSON panels. Every editor must support keyboard navigation, search/filter affordances, undo/revert actions, and immediate validation feedback.
* Surface dependency and validation issues proactively. Leverage services such as `DependencyIndex`, `apply_effect_action_dependencies`, and runtime registries to flag missing assets, keywords, or hooks before users commit changes.
* Keep visual layouts consistent with existing splitter-based workspaces: resizable panes, sticky toolbars, footer button boxes, and scroll areas for long forms. Respect GUI styling already established in the codebase.
* Provide quick links to assets, logs, and automation (e.g., open art directories, jump to launch history) so creators can execute full workflows without leaving the GUI.
* Mirror REST and runtime capabilities exactly. If the runtime supports a configuration flag, hook, or schema field, expose it in the GUI with sensible defaults and validation. Never rely on hidden configuration files.

## Core Character-Creation Workflows

Implement or enhance GUI flows so creators can finish each workflow end-to-end without external tooling:

1. **New Character + Deck** – Streamlined onboarding that covers character identity (stats, animations, starter relics/potions), deck drafting, card art assignment, localization, and bundle wiring in a single story-driven surface.
2. **Character + Deck + Upgrades + Unlocks** – Integrate upgrade tier editors, unlock rule scheduling, mastery progress previews, and reward tables that connect to `CardUpgrade`, `CardDefinition.unlocks`, and runtime unlock registries.
3. **Character + Deck + Stances + Upgrades + Unlocks** – Add stance designers with asset previews, entry/exit effects, stance-specific card pools, and contextual validation tying into BaseMod stance APIs and our runtime stance registries.
4. **Character + Deck + Stances + Upgrades + Unlocks + Sequenced Combos** – Provide tooling for sequencing cards (ordered tags, effect graph triggers, timeline preview) so authors can define card chains that trigger special effects using effect graphs and dependency injection.
5. **Character + Deck + Stances + Upgrades + Unlocks + Sequenced Combos + Custom Keywords** – Embed keyword designers with localization, icon previews, binding to cards/powers/relics, and automatic injection of keyword dependencies into bundles.
6. **All of the Above + Generated Cards** – Offer intuitive ways to author cards that create or transform other cards (e.g., using effect graph templates, preview pools, and generation rules) with guard rails that verify downstream card availability.

## Extended Workflows Required by the Existing Codebase

The repository already supports far more than the character-centric flows above. Every GUI enhancement must honour these capabilities and provide cohesive user stories for them:

* **Content Authoring Tabs** – Maintain and expand the tabbed workspace covering cards, relics, potions, powers, enemies, events, block modifiers, damage modifiers, extra effect modifiers, overlays, encounter packs, custom targeting, custom icons, mod badges (EasyConfig), and global localization. Each tab must include list management, duplication, validation, localization editing, flavor support, and previews consistent with the existing widgets.
* **Effect Graph Authoring** – Ensure effect graph editors expose the complete `EffectActionCatalog`, condition builders, queue controls, dependency auto-injection, and sequence/trigger visualisations. Provide templates for common combos (block modifiers, damage modifiers, extra effects) and highlight missing dependencies from services like `apply_effect_action_dependencies`.
* **Asset & Icon Management** – Integrate asset catalog browsing, drag-and-drop import, and inline previews for card art, relic icons, power textures, stance visuals, overlay assets, and custom icons defined in `AssetCatalog` and `CustomIconDefinition`.
* **Keyword & Localization Governance** – Include keyword registries, localization editors, and translation status dashboards that span cards, powers, relics, potions, overlays, UI strings, and custom keywords (`KeywordDefinition`, `LocalizationBlock`, `UIStringsEntry`). Track missing translations and enforce default language completeness.
* **Stance & Targeting Designers** – Build dedicated surfaces for stance behaviour and custom targeting (`CustomTargetingDefinition`, `CardCustomTargeting`), including fallback strategies, animation hooks, and gameplay previews.
* **Overlay & HUD Builder** – Provide layout tooling for ModLib overlays (`OverlayDefinition`), including anchor selection, widget trees, bindings, localization, condition gating, formatter usage, z-index previews, and runtime integration checks.
* **Encounter & Act Planning** – Cover `ActDefinition`, `EncounterPackDefinition`, and enemy configuration with map previews, encounter sequencing, reward rules, and boss/event integration. Tie these flows into bundle packaging and progression planning.
* **Runtime Hook & Modifier Management** – Surface authoring for block modifiers, damage modifiers, powers, extra effect modifiers, and subscriber lifecycle hooks so users can attach runtime behaviours without touching Java. Visualise hook coverage and conflicts across cards, relics, and powers.
* **Automation & Deployment** – Maintain seamless access to launch profile management, launch history auditing, Out-Jar inspection, JD-GUI/Luyten reports, and bundle export. Any new workflow must be callable from both the GUI and the REST API.
* **Bundle Packaging & Dependency Validation** – Guide users through compiling complete `BundleDefinition` payloads, verifying dependencies (`DependencyReference`), packaging assets, emitting manifests, and exporting ready-to-use bundles with audit trails.
* **EasyConfig Authoring** – Ensure the mod badge/EasyConfig editor remains tightly integrated with `EasyConfigDefinition`, field type registries, and UI Strings so configuration panels are generated without manual edits.

## Interaction & Validation Rules

* Every editor must provide Save, Revert, Duplicate (when applicable), and Delete affordances with confirmation prompts. Disable destructive actions when validation fails.
* Present inline validation with explicit messaging (no silent failures). Highlight fields with problems, provide actionable tooltips, and link to the relevant documentation snippet when possible.
* Offer previews wherever the runtime supports them (card art, stance animations, overlay layouts, effect graph simulations). Previews must refresh immediately after edits.
* Manage state transitions carefully: editing a list item must prompt to save or discard when switching items; background autosave is prohibited unless explicitly described in `developmentplan.md`.
* Keep forms vertically grouped into logical sections with collapsible `QGroupBox` widgets for advanced settings (e.g., STSLib hooks). Default to collapsed when sections are optional.
* Ensure keyboard shortcuts mirror standard conventions (Ctrl+S to save, Ctrl+Z to revert within text editors, arrow keys for list navigation) and document them in tooltips or help overlays.

## Documentation, Testing, and Parity

* Update or add GUI unit tests (`tests/gui/`) whenever you introduce new widgets, validation logic, or workflows. Tests must cover form population, validation gating, and persistence wiring.
* Synchronise REST endpoints with GUI workflows. If a GUI action manipulates bundles, launch profiles, or content definitions, confirm equivalent REST routes exist and update `restapi.md` accordingly.
* Keep the YAML example (`example_project.yaml`) and serialization schemas current whenever GUI changes introduce new data fields or structures.
* Record any newly discovered requirements or follow-up tasks in `developmentplan.md` with `[todo]` markers, and append matching updates to `guistructure.md` before implementation.

Breaking any of these rules is treated as a blocking violation; work must stop until the GUI adheres to every mandate above.

# Research-Informed GUI Additions (Slay the Spire Modding Realities)

> The following sections **extend** the protocol with concrete, GUI-only behaviors aligned with StS modding APIs and community conventions.

## Global Workspace & Layout Contracts

* **Primary frame** remains a splitter-based studio with:

  * **Left rail:** Project Explorer (content trees by type: Cards/Relics/Powers/…); quick filters (rarity/type/color/tags) and a “Show unlocalized/invalid” toggle.
  * **Center editor:** Form + live preview (card canvas, character select, event node, overlay, encounter map).
  * **Right rail:** **Context Panel** (dependencies, validation messages, linked assets, where-used graph, launch profile short cuts).
  * **Footer:** Status + “Lint/Validate” + “Open Logs” + “Launch with ModTheSpire” buttons (launch integration is already supported by the codebase; the GUI only invokes it).
  * **Sticky action bar:** Save / Revert / Duplicate / Delete, and **Preview Mode** switch (e.g., card inspect vs library tile).
* **Search first:** Global search (Ctrl/Cmd+K) finds IDs like `myModID:Flare`, keywords, or asset file names across all tabs with jump-to results. (IDs are a BaseMod convention; see examples in the wiki where IDs look like `myModID:Flare`.) ([GitHub][1])
* **ID collision banner:** Top-level red banner in any editor if current ID conflicts project-wide (including content removed from lists but still referenced by events/encounters).

## Canonical Asset Sizes & Preview Rules (enforced by the GUI)

Add inline **size validators** and **auto-fit previewers** with the following baked-in hints:

* **Card face images (library tile):** `250×190` px. The **inspect portrait** is discovered by adding `_p` to the filename and should be `500×380` px. GUI enforces presence of both files (or a toggle “Use same art scaled”). ([GitHub][1])
* **Custom card frame parts:** Background, Orb, and Banner textures commonly use `512×512` (small) and `1024×1024` (large) for backgrounds/banners, and `512×512` (small) with `164×164` (inspect orb) for the energy orb. Previews snap to these sizes and warn on mismatch. ([GitHub][1])
* **Character select portrait:** `1920×1200` px; GUI shows crop guides and a “safe area” overlay mirroring the Character Select screen. ([GitHub][2])
* **Character campfire shoulders/corpse & Spine:** Show dedicated slots for shoulder1/shoulder2/corpse plus Spine (atlas/json) with a small runtime-style pose preview and frame-rate slider (GUI preview only; no engine work). ([GitHub][2])

## Localization & Keywords—First-Class, Not Add-Ons

* **ID & Strings discipline:** Each content editor includes an **ID field** (readable and copyable) and a **Strings panel** bound to BaseMod’s “Custom Strings” types (CardStrings, RelicStrings, PowerStrings, EventStrings, etc.). The GUI guarantees that every content item has a corresponding entry in the active language file(s), and warns if the default language is incomplete. ([GitHub][3])
* **Keyword Studio:**

  * Visual table for `keywords.json` entries (proper name, aliases, description) per language.
  * **Usage heatmap**: shows which cards/powers/relics reference a keyword in their descriptions.
  * **Auto-register reminder:** Inline tip: “Keywords are registered in `receiveEditKeywords` via BaseMod.addKeyword; ensure your modID is lowercase.” (GUI side only; aligns with BaseMod docs.) ([GitHub][4])
* **Language switcher** in the toolbar re-renders previews (cards, tooltips) using that language’s strings to catch truncation/overflow early. (BaseMod exposes string types & lookup; GUI mirrors the concept.) ([GitHub][3])

## “New Character” Wizard—What the GUI Must Walk Through

* **Step 1: Identity & Visuals.** Name, class strings (CharacterStrings), color swatch, select portrait (1920×1200), shoulders/corpse, Spine files; live preview of Character Select tile. Size checks as above. ([GitHub][2])
* **Step 2: Economy & Base Stats.** Energy/turn, HP, gold, starting hand size; tooltips explain common defaults (e.g., 3 energy/turn).
* **Step 3: Starter Kit.** Starting deck/relics/potions with quick-create of missing cards/relics (opens sub-dialogs and returns).
* **Step 4: Card Color & Frames.** Bind custom color and optional background/orb/banner textures with validators (512/1024 family). ([GitHub][1])
* **Step 5: Stances (optional).** Add/edit stance entries with entry/exit previews and per-stance card pool filter.
* **Step 6: Localization/Keywords recap.** Inline diffs of strings and keywords added by the wizard; confirm “green” before Finish.

All steps **auto-populate** IDs following `myModID:ThingName` and keep a **reserved prefix** list per project to avoid collisions, as seen in BaseMod examples. ([GitHub][1])

## Cards Editor—Visual First, Schema Complete

* **Canvas editor** with left-side **Card Anatomy** (Name, Cost, Type, Rarity, Target, Color), center **Live Card**, right-side **Numbers & Flags** (damage/block/magic, retain/exhaust/ethereal, tags).
* **Inspect Toggle** uses `_p` portrait and shows full description rendering using the selected language (so you see keyword tooltips formatted correctly). ([GitHub][1])
* **Upgrade Track** table: base vs upgraded deltas, with computed display of text changes.
* **Frame parts** (background/orb/banner) surfaces that enforce size families; drop-zones set/preview textures and warn on wrong dimensions. ([GitHub][1])
* **Effect Graph hook-ins:** From a card row, a “Define Play Effects…” button opens the effect graph editor at the correct node, with a test harness that simulates damage/power application sequences. (GUI only; modeling after BaseMod hooks.) ([GitHub][5])

## Powers/Relics/Potions—Consistency & Shortcutting

* **Relic editor** includes tier, pool, image pickers, and strings; shows “unlock seen” hint mirroring BaseMod examples. (GUI hint text references UnlockTracker in examples for context, no engine logic.) ([GitHub][2])
* **Power editor** renders **on-card tooltips** and a **turn-tick** simulator to preview passive vs stack behavior (visual only).
* **Potion editor** supports rarity, lab availability, room pools, and preview of top-panel icon.

## Stances, Orbs & Custom Targeting

* **Stance designer**: entry/exit VFX dropdowns, stance-specific keyword overlays, live tooltips, and “card pool filter” to mark cards available only within a stance. (BaseMod exposes stances via APIs; GUI mirrors assets/strings surfaces.) ([GitHub][5])
* **Orb designer**: (for characters that use them) show an **orb slot** count nudge and a **passive/evoke blurb** preview referencing Defect conventions; include a doc link tip. ([slay-the-spire.fandom.com][6])
* **Custom Targeting**: a compact builder for selectors (self/enemy/all/random/front/back), with a run-time style **target highlight** preview. (GUI concept aligned with “Custom Targeting” authoring in your Extended Workflows.)

## Events & Encounter Planning

* **Event editor** shows the **node dialog** structure (option buttons, consequences), renders **UIStrings** per language, and surfaces “uses/unlocks/removes” impacts (cards/relics/powers). (Strings types include EventStrings/UIStrings in BaseMod.) ([GitHub][3])
* **Act/Encounter planner**: side map with draggable **encounter packs**; each encounter shows enemy lineup and reward rules.

## Effect Graph Authoring—Author-Friendly Views

* **Node palette** mirrors your `EffectActionCatalog` categories with search. Each node displays **required dependencies**; missing ones raise inline errors (e.g., “Needs keyword X, relic Y”). (Aligns with your dependency services.)
* **Timeline & Trigger view**: visualize **onDraw/onDiscard/onUse/onStartOfTurn**, etc., mirroring common BaseMod hooks available to mods (GUI concept; hooks exist per BaseMod wiki). ([GitHub][5])
* **Dry-run simulator**: a “Run” button uses test inputs to show the order of queued actions and tooltips that would appear. (GUI-only simulation; no engine patching here.)

## Keyword Governance—Safe-By-Default

* **Lowercase enforcement:** The GUI enforces lowercase keyword aliases (as BaseMod expects), and warns if `modID` isn’t all-lowercase when registering keywords. ([GitHub][4])
* **Alias conflicts:** Detect collisions across languages (e.g., English alias matching another keyword’s alias) and present a resolve dialog.
* **Card text linter:** Highlights **dangling keyword markers** (capitalization or pluralization not covered by aliases) and offers “Add alias” quick-fix. (BaseMod suggests alias arrays like `{"block","blocks"}`.) ([GitHub][4])

## Validation Matrix (examples the GUI must check before Save/Export)

* **Assets present & sized:** Card face `250×190`, `_p` portrait `500×380`, character select `1920×1200`, frame parts in the 512/1024 family; orb inspect `164×164`. ([GitHub][1])
* **GUI upload validation:** Every asset uploaded through the GUI must be immediately checked to confirm its format and resolution match the requirements for that specific asset type. If the asset fails validation, the upload must be blocked and the user must receive a verbose, friendly, non-technical explanation describing what to fix.
* **Strings coverage:** For each content type (Card/Relic/Power/Event/Potion/UI/Character/Orb/RunMod/Blight), required string keys exist in the active default language. ([GitHub][3])
* **Keyword registration feasibility:** All referenced keywords exist in `keywords.json` for the default language, and the keyword list can be registered (GUI can show the code pattern per BaseMod docs). ([GitHub][4])
* **ID conventions:** `modID:ThingName` format, unique across the project; warn on illegal characters/spaces; preview the resulting resource paths as they’ll be looked up.
* **Hook coverage warnings:** If a card references a behavior category (e.g., “onDraw”) without any effect graph or power handling it, flag a non-blocking warning (maps to common BaseMod hooks). ([GitHub][5])

## List Management & Libraries

* **Compendiums** per type show grid/list with **compare** (A/B diff of two cards’ numbers, text, and keywords).
* **Mass edit** (multi-select): change rarity/pools/tags in bulk; localized strings remain per-item.
* **Import from existing mods**: drop a folder of resources to pre-fill images/strings into the current project (GUI copies references; no jar parsing).

## Launch & Testing Shortcuts (GUI-side, parity with existing automation)

* **One-click Launch (ModTheSpire)**: panel to pick classpath, enable/disable installed mods, and **auto-check** “BaseMod & StSLib present” (they’re commonly required by content mods). If absent, the GUI shows a non-blocking notice with links. ([GitHub][5])
* **Dev Console tip**: Inline note that BaseMod’s dev console exists for in-game testing (your app just launches; console is in-game). ([GitHub][5])

## Accessibility & Editing Comfort

* **Keyboard parity**: Full nav with arrows/Tab; Ctrl/Cmd+Enter = “Apply+Preview”.
* **Color-blind friendly**: Provide label/badge alternatives (icons and text) in addition to color coding for rarity/pools.
* **Text overflow guards**: In previews, show soft bounds and wrap indicators for multi-line descriptions (use the `_p` portrait view to test long text).

## Help & Documentation Surfaces

* **Contextual help language mandate:** Every tooltip, overlay, panel, quickstart, or other assistance surface must speak in easy, non-technical language that only discusses the GUI elements currently in view. These helpers must never quote or reference any `.md` file, external tutorial, guide, or source comment.
* **Inline doc links** per field (opens right-rail help) that summarize the corresponding BaseMod page and call out **what the GUI enforces**:

  * “Card art & portraits” → shows size table and `_p` naming rule. ([GitHub][1])
  * “Custom Strings” → lists types (CardStrings, RelicStrings, …) and the **receiveEditStrings** idea (GUI-only explanation). ([GitHub][3])
  * “Keywords” → lowercase aliases, `keywords.json`, and registration callback. ([GitHub][4])
* **Troubleshooting chips**: Common pitfalls like missing StSLib when mods expect it (GUI can’t fix, but can warn). ([GitHub][7])

## Opinionated Defaults (because friction kills creativity)

* New card defaults to Type=SKILL, Cost=1, Rarity=COMMON, Target=ENEMY, with placeholder art panel prompting a **drag image here** action and a **Generate temp frame** button that builds a neutral frame at correct sizes (for preview only).
* New character defaults to 3 energy/turn, 75 HP, and a color auto-derived from your project theme—editable anytime.
* New keyword editor opens with “aliases” pre-seeded for pluralization (e.g., “spark” → “spark”, “sparks”) and **lowercase enforced**. ([GitHub][4])

## Non-Goals (to keep this file GUI-only)

* No bytecode patching, no engine lifecycle, no BaseMod subscriber wiring here. The GUI **reflects** these concepts for authors, validates assets/IDs/strings/keywords, and calls existing REST actions.

# Source-Anchored Reference Notes (for contributors)

* **BaseMod wiki (cards, strings, keywords, hooks, textures & sizes, IDs):** Card images `250×190`, portraits `_p` `500×380`; texture size families for background/orb/banner; examples of IDs like `myModID:Flare`; string types (CardStrings, RelicStrings, EventStrings, etc.); registering keywords from `keywords.json`. ([GitHub][1])
* **Custom character visuals:** Character select portrait `1920×1200`; shoulders/corpse/Spine pointers. ([GitHub][2])
* **Mod loader & common libs:** ModTheSpire as the loader; BaseMod as the API; StSLib provides shared mechanics/keywords (many mods expect it). (GUI should warn if absent in launch config, but not manage binaries.) ([GitHub][8])
* **Orbs & stance context:** Orbs are a Defect mechanic (orb slots, passive/evoke), useful for preview education in the GUI. ([slay-the-spire.fandom.com][6])

# Three quick layers (so the whole team’s on the same page)

**Beginner (plain talk):** The GUI is a pro editor that lets you make StS content without code. It knows the **right image sizes**, the **right names**, where text and **keywords** live, and it yells early when something’s off. You edit on the left, see it in the middle, fix problems on the right, and press Launch to try it with ModTheSpire.

**Intermediate (what actually happens):** Each editor is a form + preview bound to content types (cards, relics, powers…). The GUI validates **IDs (`myModID:Thing`)**, checks **assets** (e.g., card art `250×190`, portrait `_p` `500×380`, character select `1920×1200`), and enforces **localization** coverage using BaseMod’s string types. Keywords are managed in a dedicated table mirroring `keywords.json` with lowercase aliases and usage checks. Effect graphs open from cards/powers for visual authoring. Launch controls integrate with ModTheSpire, and the GUI warns if BaseMod/StSLib aren’t present.

**Expert (pitfalls & edge cases):**

* Most “it works on my machine” bugs come from **bad sizes** or **missing `_p` portraits**—we hard-fail export on those. ([GitHub][1])
* **Keywords** must be **lowercase aliases** and registered in the proper callback; we lint for dangling terms and pluralization. ([GitHub][4])
* **ID collisions** across content types are easy to make when cloning—our global ID index prevents it.
* **Localization truncation** often only shows in the **inspect** view—hence a dedicated portrait preview with overflow markers. ([GitHub][1])
* Launching with random mod sets often implicitly requires **StSLib**; we show a friendly warning instead of letting users face a cryptic in-game failure. ([GitHub][9])

**Bold takeaway:** Wire a **one-click “Red Flags Only” filter** that dims the whole UI and shows *only* invalid/missing items (assets, IDs, strings, keywords). In practice, that single toggle cuts 80% of “why doesn’t my run start?” support pings on modding projects like this.
